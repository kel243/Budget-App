# Budget-App

Practicing building of RESTful APIs with a single user budget application to keep track of budget in the current month.

User can create categories with set budget limits and add purchases.

Purchases can be categorized or non-categorized and categorized purchases will cause recalculation of the category's remaining budget.

Both categories and purchases are updated with AJAJ.

Made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Flask.
